const content = `Hey, I’m Aditya Singh — born in 2007 (the date doesn’t matter, the journey does).
I’m currently pursuing pre-med, while also diving deep into coding and technology, because I believe curiosity across fields builds sharper perspectives and a stronger mind.

I’m ambitious — but I’ll admit, lazy on some days. The gym plan from 2022 is still waiting its moment, but growth isn’t always about muscle — sometimes it’s mental, emotional, and unseen.

Somewhere between logic and emotion — that’s where I exist.
Not in a rush to impress — just focused on building something real.
I’m good at heart, and I admit I have flaws, but none that harm others.
I’m aware of my boundaries — and I respect them.

I’m trying to learn everything, to build something big (can’t describe it yet — it’s still top secret 👀), and to stay focused on becoming a better version of myself every day.

Life hasn’t been simple, but I’ve learned to take it one step at a time — growing, improving, and staying grounded.
I don’t chase perfection anymore; I chase progress and peace.

I believe in big dreams, quiet effort, and finding meaning even in random thoughts.
Just a human — learning, leveling up, and enjoying the journey as it unfolds.`;
